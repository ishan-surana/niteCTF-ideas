+ ``frame_splitter.py`` splits video into frames. images are now in images/source folder.<br>
+ each frame is now put in a pcap file after xoring using `xorpcaper.py` with fake flag **nite{4lmo5t_th3re_bu+_n0t_yet!}**.<br>
+ `unxorpcaper.py` unxors and gets the original images in "reformed" folder.<br>
+ one of the images will be lsbd using steghide and password will be the fakeflag used for xoring as well which is **nite{4lmo5t_th3re_bu+_n0t_yet!}**. currently that image is 69.jpg and result is ``covered.jpg``
